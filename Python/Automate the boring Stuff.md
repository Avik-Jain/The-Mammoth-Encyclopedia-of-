### What is Truthy and Falsy in python? How is it different from True and False?

This condition is kind of weird the name variable is set to whatever the user is typed in but input
will be returning a string value not a boolean true or false value.
The reason this code works is that the conditions can use truthy and false values for strings.
The blank string is a falsie value condition evaluates to the blank string.
It's considered to be the same as the false Boolean values.
All the other non-blank string values are truthy values.

For instance, to see if a list is not empty, instead of checking like this:

if len(my_list) != 0:
   print "Not empty!"
You can simply do this:

if my_list:
   print "Not empty!"
This is because some values, such as empty lists, are considered False when evaluated for a boolean value. Non-empty lists are True.

Similarly for the integer 0, the empty string "", and so on, for False, and non-zero integers, non-empty strings, and so on, for True.

The idea of terms like "truthy" and "falsy" simply refer to those values which are considered True in cases like those described above, and those which are considered False.

For example, an empty list ([]) is considered "falsy", and a non-empty list (for example, [1]) is considered "truthy".


### To recap 
an if statement can be used to conditionally execute code depending on whether or not the if statements condition is true or false.

In l if that is an else if statement can follow an if statement in its block executes if the condition is true and all the previous conditions have been false in.

Else statement comes at the end.

Its block is executed if all the previous conditions have been false.

And finally the values zero zero point zero and the empty string are considered to be false values when used in conditions they are considered to be the same as the false Boolean values.
You can always see which for yourself which values are truth your falsie by passing them to the bool function

### To recap 
while statements are similar to if statements except that once the execution reaches the end

of a while statements block it jumps back to the start and rechecks condition.

If you ever get stuck in a loop where you just want to quickly terminate your python program you can

just press ctrl + C .

See a break statement will cause the execution to immediately leave the loop without rechecking the

condition and a continue statement will cause the execution to immediately jump back to the start of

a loop and recheck the condition.

### What is Python's range() Function?
As an experienced Python developer, or even a beginner, you've likely heard of the Python range() function. But what does it do? In a nutshell, it generates a list of numbers, which is generally used to iterate over with for loops. There's many use cases. Often you will want to use this when you want to perform an action X number of times, where you may or may not care about the index. Other times you may want to iterate over a list (or another iterable object), while being able to have the index available.
The range() function works a little bit differently between Python 2.x and 3.x under the hood, however the concept is the same. We'll get to that a bit later, however.

Python's range() Parameters
The range() function has two sets of parameters, as follows:

range(stop)

stop: Number of integers (whole numbers) to generate, starting from zero. eg. range(3) == [0, 1, 2].
range([start], stop[, step])

start: Starting number of the sequence.
stop: Generate numbers up to, but not including this number.
step: Difference between each number in the sequence.
Note that:

All parameters must be integers.
All parameters can be positive or negative.
range() (and Python in general) is 0-index based, meaning list indexes start at 0, not 1. eg. The syntax to access the first element of a list is mylist[0]. Therefore the last integer generated by range() is up to, but not including, stop. For example range(0, 5) generates integers from 0 up to, but not including, 5.
